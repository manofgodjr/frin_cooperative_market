This proposal outlines the development of a robust and scalable "Cooperative App" designed to revolutionize how cooperative members manage their records, transactions, and interactions. It also integrates a vibrant marketplace, enabling vendors to establish online stores and engage in e-commerce activities, fostering local commerce within the cooperative ecosystem. Leveraging modern technologies (Flutter for frontend, Django for backend), this application prioritizes performance, security, and scalability to support a large and growing user base.
